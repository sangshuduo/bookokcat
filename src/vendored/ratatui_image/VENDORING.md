# Vendored: ratatui-image

This directory contains a vendored copy of [ratatui-image](https://github.com/benjajaja/ratatui-image) v8.0.1.

## Original Project

- **Project**: ratatui-image
- **Author**: Benjamin Große <ste3ls@gmail.com>
- **Repository**: https://github.com/benjajaja/ratatui-image
- **License**: MIT (see LICENSE file in this directory)
- **Version**: 8.0.1

## Why Vendored?

This library has been vendored into bookokcat with performance-specific modifications that are too application-specific to contribute upstream. The changes include:

1. **Kitty Protocol Compression**: Added zlib compression for Kitty protocol image transmission to reduce bandwidth usage during image rendering
2. **Viewport Rendering Fix**: Fixed viewport cropping for non-tiling protocols to properly handle viewport offsets

## Modifications

All modifications are tracked in the bookokcat git repository. The original git history has been preserved in this document for attribution purposes.

### Performance Changes
- Added flate2 dependency for zlib compression
- Modified `src/protocol/kitty.rs` to compress image data before transmission
- Modified `src/lib.rs` to properly handle viewport cropping for non-Kitty protocols
